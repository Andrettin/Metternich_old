Coding Guidelines for Metternich

1. Class, member variable and function names are in PascalCase.

2. Function names generally begin with a verb in the imperative, for example: DoSomething().

3. Local variable names are in snake_case.

4. Prefer defining functions in headers if they don't require any external includes (which aren't already in the precompiled headers), so that the compiler is able to inline the functions if it deems optimal to do so, thus providing performance improvements.

5. Braces are always used for "if" statements.

6. Header files are included in the following order: first the header which corresponds to the current source file, then the other Metternich headers, then headers for third-party libraries, then Qt headers, and finally standard library headers.

7. Documentation headers for functions are located where the function definition is, regardless of whether that is in a header or source file.

8. Class definitions should be ordered in the following fashion: first, any macros which define a portion of the class (e.g. the Q_OBJECT macro). Then, typedefs, followed by enumerations, constant expressions, static methods, static variables, instance methods and finally instance variables. Within each of these, public ones are to be followed by protected members, and finally private ones.

9. The precompiled headers should include all library/third party headers used by the engine, but no headers belonging to Metternich itself. This way, compile times are reduced substantially, without
